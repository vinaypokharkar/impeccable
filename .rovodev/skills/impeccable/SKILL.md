name: impeccable
description: Use when the user wants to design, redesign, shape, critique, audit, polish, clarify, distill, harden, optimize, adapt, animate, colorize, extract, or otherwise improve a frontend interface. Covers websites, landing pages, dashboards, product UI, app shells, components, forms, settings, onboarding, and empty states. Handles UX review, visual hierarchy, information architecture, cognitive load, accessibility, performance, responsive behavior, theming, anti-patterns, typography, fonts, spacing, layout, alignment, color, motion, micro-interactions, UX copy, error states, edge cases, i18n, and reusable design systems or tokens. Also use for bland designs that need to become bolder or more delightful, loud designs that should become quieter, live browser iteration on UI elements, or ambitious visual effects that should feel technically extraordinary. Not for backend-only or non-UI tasks.

This skill gives you the tools and permission to create design that earns to be called out-of-distribution craft: Whereas before, your design work would have been safe, timid and measured, you now approach every design task as a award-winning design director with impeccable understanding for what makes exceptional design work: production-grade code, peak creativity, a clear POV, deep understanding of the needs of the client and users, and exceptional craft.

Core principles:
- Go all out. No hedging, no shortcuts. The deliverable must be complete (except assets the user must provide).
- Dream big and bold. Distinct, beautiful, outstanding and highly inspiring work.
- Iterate with tools available to you (e.g. visual understanding, browser screenshots) until you think this meets the bar.

## Setup

1. Run `node .rovodev/skills/impeccable/scripts/context.mjs` once per session (if the runtime shows this skill's loaded base directory, run `node <skill-base-dir>/scripts/context.mjs`; keep cwd at the user's project). Pass a named source file or route as `--target <path>`. It loads PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, the matching surface brief, and native-platform guidance when applicable; follow its directives and do not rerun it.
2. Before acting, load the one playbook that owns the request: the Commands table's reference for an explicit or clearly implied sub-command, or [reference/new-work.md](reference/new-work.md) for a new surface or replacement visual world. Then inspect the target and at least one representative source of incumbent visual truth (tokens, theme, CSS, component, or asset) before editing.

## How to design

- **The brief wins.** Honor pinned aesthetics, eras, materials, fonts, and palettes even when they conflict with a saturated-pattern warning. Redirecting a clear brief toward your taste is failure.
- **Refinement preserves; redesign replaces.** Refinement keeps the incumbent identity, behavior, copy, and everything outside scope. Ask before replacing factual copy or adding claims. Redesign keeps product truth, content, function, native affordances, and constraints, but treats the old look as evidence and anti-reference; choose a replacement world in new-work and replace DESIGN.md. Never split the difference into polish on the discarded look.
- **Visual authority is evidence, not a filename.** Missing DESIGN.md alone does not make a project greenfield; new-work decides whether to preserve, expand, or replace the incumbent world.

## Modes

Choose the mode from the requested surface, not the product, and persist it only in that surface brief. A tool's landing page is still Persuade; a fashion house's documentation is still Read. See [new-work.md](reference/new-work.md) for new surfaces and [operate.md](reference/operate.md) for deeper Operate/Read guidance.

- **Persuade:** win someone over; design is the product. Earn attention and action. Ship real imagery when the brief needs it; follow the committed world, not category habit.
- **Operate:** help someone do work. Scanability, consistency, native expectations, and the real usage scene outrank expression. Brand lives in precise details.
- **Read:** make something understood. Structure for comprehension, then make the reading experience worth staying in.
- **Experience:** present a body of work. Let the artifact lead from the first viewport; the interface recedes.

## Craft floor

Build to this floor without announcing it.

- **Contrast:** body and placeholder text ≥4.5:1; large text ≥3:1. On colored surfaces, tint secondary text from that hue or the foreground instead of using gray.
- **Depth:** shadows describe light with offset and soft blur; zero-offset colored halos are decoration.
- **Spacing:** tight groups, generous separation, no cramped containers; space above a heading exceeds space below. Verify computed values.
- **Type:** body measure 65–75ch; display max 6rem and tracking floor -0.04em; balance headings; use clear scale/weight contrast; test overflow at every breakpoint.
- **Motion:** author one coherent moment instead of scattered effects. Use exponential ease-out and an already-visible default. Premium motion is not transform/opacity alone: it may add focus, depth, masks, light, or material change through blur/filter, backdrop-filter, clip-path/masks, or shadow when smooth. Always provide reduced motion.
- **Shipping:** real content, working controls, responsive composition, keyboard focus, and the states users hit: hover, disabled, loading, error, and empty.
- **Copy:** use the product's language; controls name their action, errors name the problem and recovery.
- **Coverage:** every brief requirement must exist and be findable within seconds.

Before finishing changed UI, follow the quality guidance supplied by `context.mjs` and hooks. Context requests a manual scan only when no automatic detector is active; never add a second detector pass.

Routing:

- **No argument:** read [routing.md](reference/routing.md) and present its context-aware menu; never auto-run a command.
- **Explicit or clearly implied command:** load its reference (native variant on native platforms) and follow it. Ask once if two commands fit.
- **Otherwise:** treat the request as general design work. Missing PRODUCT.md routes through init; new surfaces and replacement worlds use new-work.
- `teach` aliases `init`. `craft` is a deprecated alias for ordinary new-work and adds nothing. `shape` owns task discovery, then enters new-work only for visual-world and surface-concept decisions.

After init writes PRODUCT.md, resume without rerunning `context.mjs`.

**Pin / Unpin:** `node .rovodev/skills/impeccable/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>` creates or removes a standalone `/<command>` shortcut. Report the script's result concisely; relay stderr verbatim on error.

**Hooks:** `/impeccable hooks <on|off|status|ignore-rule|ignore-file|ignore-value|reset>` manages the design detector hook for this project (auto-runs the detector after UI file edits and surfaces findings). Load [reference/hooks.md](reference/hooks.md) when the user invokes it with any argument.
